Fetched news from this API: https://bit.ly/InShortsNewsAPI used in API/Context.js, as shown above.

## Improvements

1. Given the type of API used, it can also fetch news from other countries. (Here I have used only India.)

2. Trending news and top stories can also be included in the categories section.

3. Bookmark a particular page and save it for later.
